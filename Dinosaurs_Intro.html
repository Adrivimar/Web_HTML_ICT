    <h2>What Is A <strong>Dinosaur?</strong></h2>
    <strong> <br>
      
      <p> Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles[note 1] of the clade
        Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic period,<br>
        between 245 and 233.23 million years ago (mya), although the exact
        origin and timing of the evolution of dinosaurs is the subject of active
        research. <br>

        They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the
        Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201.3 mya; their dominance continued
        throughout the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. <br>
        The fossil record shows that birds are feathered dinosaurs, having
        evolved from earlier theropods during the Late Jurassic epoch, and are
        the only dinosaur lineage known to have survived <br>
        the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event approximately 66 mya.
        Dinosaurs can therefore be divided into avian dinosaurs—birds—and the
        extinct non-avian dinosaurs, which are all <br>
        dinosaurs other than birds.<br>

          While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal, many extinct groups included quadrupedal <br>
species, and some were able to shift between these stances. <br>
 Elaborate display structures such as horns or crests are common to all dinosaur groups, <br>
 and some extinct groups developed skeletal modifications such as bony armor and spines. <br>
 While the dinosaurs' modern-day surviving avian lineage (birds) are generally small due to the constraints of flight, <br>
 many prehistoric dinosaurs (non-avian and avian) were large-bodied—the largest sauropod dinosaurs<br>
 are estimated to have reached lengths of 39.7 meters (130 feet) and heights of 18 m (59 ft) and were <br>
the largest land animals of all time. The misconception that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic <br>
is based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized. <br>
 Many dinosaurs were quite small, some measuring about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length. <br>
The first dinosaur fossils were recognized in the early 19th century, with the name "dinosaur" (meaning "terrible lizard") <br>
being coined by Sir Richard Owen in 1841 to refer to these "great fossil lizards". Since then, mounted fossil dinosaur <br>
skeletons have been major attractions at museums worldwide, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of popular culture. <br>
 The large sizes of some dinosaurs, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured<br>
 their regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as Jurassic Park. Persistent public enthusiasm<br>
 for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. <br>
